# Reversi
> I completed this project for the course CS3500, Object-Oriented Design, which I took at Northeastern University in Fall 2023.  
> The assignment was to create a playable Java implementation of the board game Reversi.  
> The professor requested that we don't publicly publish our code, but I'm happy to temporarily make it public on request.
